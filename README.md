This document describes the specifications of ARP assignment, updated after the pandemic emergency.

The original specifications assumed that all students developed a single piece of code to be exchanged with other students, in order to carry out a cooperative experiment in the lab. As you know, labs will stay closed at least until September. Therefore, it is necessary to change the specifications and transform the cooperative project into an individual one. At the same time I want that what you have already developed will need very small modifications.

The new specifications convert the distributed/cooperative model into a single machine implementation. In the next page you can find the new specifications.

The document reports in yellow all the text changes with respect to the original sheet (V1.0). Students will produce the following documents:

<ol>
<li>source code with embedded comments (clearness is evaluated)</li>
<li>a script for compiling and executing</li>
<li>executable form</li>
<li>brief description of the source package, how to install, execution instructions</li>
<li>brief summary of the experiments and results</li>
<li>optional: generated wave plots (see final part of the document).</li>
</ol>
A repository will be setup in aulaweb for uploading the projects.

These rules are valid also for students who will do the exam in the next dates.

2019 ARP Assignment V2.0

The problem to be solved has the following specifications.

The goal is to simulate a network of multi-process systems, all identical, each one running on a machine in the same LAN, connected through sockets, exchanging a data token at a specified and measured speed. The number of machines is not given a priori. In figure 1 there are 4 machines as an example. They may be more, or less, or they may even reduce to one single machine for setup and debugging purposes.

Figure 1

In figure 2 the structure of each machine is defined. Note that a black frame encompasses each machine‚Äôs multi- process system, whereas a colored frame includes the system components that must developed by each student. Summing up, each student develops all system components of her/his machine, except for one, which is acquired by her/his partner ‚Äúright side‚Äù student; in her/his turn, the student develops a component that is to be given to, and integrated by the‚Äùleft side‚Äù student (‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúleft‚Äù refer to the schema in figure 2).

Glossary.

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Circles are Posix processes.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Process P receives tokens, computes and sends an updated token after a given delay (see the waiting
time below).
</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Process L logs data end events in a log file.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Process G receives tokens and dispatches them to P.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Process S receives console messages as Posix signals.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Processes S and G are connected to P through non-deterministic pipes (Posix select).</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;A socket connects P to the partner‚Äôs G process.
Detailed specifications.

A configuration file in the machine contains in text format the necessary parameters, and is edited by the user before running the multi-process:
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;IP address of the machine and port numbers of processes (where relevant)</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;reference frequency (RF) of the generated token wave</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;waiting time (in microseconds) applied by process P before sending the updated token (initially: 1,000)</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;other relevant data to be read before starting.
Token is:

ÔÇ∑ a floating point number between -1. and 1, plus ÔÇ∑

P does the following computation:

new token = received token + DT x (1. ‚Äì (received token)^2/2) x 2 pi x RF

where DT is the time delay between the reception and delivery time instants (that ). In this way the token series forms a sine wave of frequency RF.

Log file

holds a series of text lines in couples: &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;from G | from S &gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;sent value&gt; (a sample of the wave)

The log file contents is output anytime G receives a suitable request from the console

S receives signals for carrying out the following actions:
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;start (receiving tokens, computing, sending tokens)</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;stop ((receiving tokens, computing, sending tokens)</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;dump log: outputs the contents of the log file, separating the wave from the actions.
Start phase

P, G, S, L start using the parameters stored in the configuration file.

The process G is given by the ‚Äúright side‚Äù student in executable form, and is run using the exec syscall.
